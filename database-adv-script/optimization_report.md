Step 1: Initial Query (Complex Join)
Save the following initial unoptimized query in performance.sql:

-- Initial complex query
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_method,
    pay.payment_date
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
Step 2: Performance Analysis with EXPLAIN
Run this in your SQL client or CLI:

EXPLAIN SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_method,
    pay.payment_date
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
Watch for inefficiencies like:

"Using temporary"

"Using filesort"

"Full table scan"

High "rows" value

Step 3: Refactored/Optimized Version
Improvements:

Limit unnecessary columns

Use indexed columns in joins

Filter early if applicable

All join columns are indexed (as we did in previous task)

-- Optimized version
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
This query:

Selects fewer columns

Joins only essential data

Leverages previously added indexes (booking_id, user_id, property_id)
