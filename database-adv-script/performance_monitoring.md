1. Monitor Query Performance with EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE
For example, let me analyze the booking retrieval query:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, u.first_name, p.name, b.start_date
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed'
AND b.start_date >= '2025-06-01';
This will show where time is spent (scanning, joining).

Look for full table scans, missing indexes, or expensive joins.

2. Identify Bottlenecks
Typical issues might be:

No index on Booking.status or Booking.start_date

Joins on non-indexed foreign keys

Large table scans for unfiltered queries

3. Suggest Schema Adjustments
From the earlier schema and indexes, if status is not indexed, add:

CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status_startdate ON Booking(status, start_date);
This composite index helps WHERE with both conditions efficiently.

If joins slow, verify indexes on foreign keys:

Booking.user_id (should already be indexed as FK)

Booking.property_id (should already be indexed as FK)

4. Implement the Change and Re-Test

-- Add composite index
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status_startdate ON Booking(status, start_date);
Re-run:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, u.first_name, p.name, b.start_date
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed'
AND b.start_date >= '2025-06-01';
5. Report Improvements
ðŸ“„ Performance Refinement Report
Before: Query performed a scan over all bookings filtered by status and date; slower response.

After: Adding composite index idx_booking_status_startdate allowed the query to efficiently seek matching rows using the index.

Result:

Reduced query execution time by X% (replace X with observed time reduction).

Lowered IO by limiting data scanned.

Recommendation: Continue monitoring other slow queries, apply similar indexing or schema tuning.
